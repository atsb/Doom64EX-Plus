// NOTES: mobj_t
//
// mobj_ts are used to tell the refresh where to draw an image,
// tell the world simulation when objects are contacted,
// and tell the sound driver how to position a sound.
//
// The refresh uses the next and prev links to follow
// lists of things in sectors as they are being drawn.
// The sprite, frame, and angle elements determine which patch_t
// is used to draw the sprite if it is visible.
// The sprite and frame values are allmost allways set
// from state_t structures.
// The statescr.exe utility generates the states.h and states.c
// files that contain the sprite/frame numbers from the
// statescr.txt source file.
// The xyz origin point represents a point at the bottom middle
// of the sprite (between the feet of a biped).
// This is the default origin position for patch_ts grabbed
// with lumpy.exe.
// A walking creature will have its z equal to the floor
// it is standing on.
//
// The sound code uses the x,y, and subsector fields
// to do stereo positioning of any sound effited by the mobj_t.
//
// The play simulation uses the blocklinks, x,y,z, radius, height
// to determine when mobj_ts are touching each other,
// touching lines in the map, or hit by trace lines (gunshots,
// lines of sight, etc).
// The mobj_t->flags element has various bit flags
// used by the simulation.
//
// Every mobj_t is linked into a single sector
// based on its origin coordinates.
// The subsector_t is found with R_PointInSubsector(x,y),
// and the sector_t can be found with subsector->sector.
// The sector links are only used by the rendering code,
// the play simulation does not care about them at all.
//
// Any mobj_t that needs to be acted upon by something else
// in the play world (block movement, be shot, etc) will also
// need to be linked into the blockmap.
// If the thing has the MF_NOBLOCK flag set, it will not use
// the block links. It can still interact with other things,
// but only as the instigator (missiles will run into other
// things, but nothing can run into a missile).
// Each block in the grid is 128*128 units, and knows about
// every line_t that it contains a piece of, and every
// interactable mobj_t that has its origin contained.
//
// A valid mobj_t is a mobj_t that has the proper subsector_t
// filled in for its xy coordinates and is linked into the
// sector from which the subsector was made, or has the
// MF_NOSECTOR flag set (the subsector_t needs to be valid
// even if MF_NOSECTOR is set), and is linked into a blockmap
// block or has the MF_NOBLOCKMAP flag set.
// Links should only be modified by the P_[Un]SetThingPosition()
// functions.
// Do not change the MF_NO? flags while a thing is valid.
//
// Any questions?
//
