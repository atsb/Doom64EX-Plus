Please remember to initialize the pthread library
by calling ptw32_processInitialize() when your
application starts. Only call it once.  This is 
required. Should you forget to do it your Xbox 
will become frozen and your debugger/IDE will crash 
if it is attached when you attempt to use any pthread
library function.

pthreads-win32 ported by Michael "Hyper_Eye" Wood
in support of the libAgar port and Odamex on behalf
of the Odamex development team.

Thanks to the pthreads-win32 developers who have
made cross-platform thread code development a
thousand times easier in the face of Microsofts
refusal to support good POSIX API on their OS.

I hope current and future Xbox homebrew developers
will find this work useful and that I might
benefit from its release by playing great new
games and using great new software on my Xbox.
